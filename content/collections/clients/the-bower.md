A lobby lounge area is framed by walls of cascading bromeliads, anthuriums and [plant] that filter in sunlight while maintaining privacy. Free-standing terra cotta planters of dracaena and [plant] in conversation areas offer thoughtful punctuations of greenery in the serene, neutral-hued surroundings.'
