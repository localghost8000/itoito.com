title: Horsefeather
description: "Located in San Francisco's NOPA neighborhood, Horsefeather's greenhouse dining room is a lush hideaway planted with hardy tropicals suited to the area's cool, foggy microclimate. Hanging hoyas and creeping ficus vines soften the space's industrial finishes, while painted lady philodendrons and pitcher plants adorning the room's above-door ledge draw the eye toward the light-flooded glass ceiling overhead."
