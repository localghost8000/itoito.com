description: "Sightglass' 20th Street and Divisadero locations demonstrate a unified vision with thoughtful distinctions based on geographical location and architecture. Occupying a corner Victorian, the Divisadero store's warm, mid-century furnishings are the backdrop for centerpiece [plants] in sculptural ceramic vessels designed in collaboration with BZIPPY. A light-filled space with floor-to-ceiling factory windows is the site of the coffee roaster's 20th Street shop, where free-standing cacti and an above-door ledge with [plant] [plant] [plant] flourish in full sunlight."
