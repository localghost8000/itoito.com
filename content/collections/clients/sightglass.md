description: "Sightglass' 20th Street and Divisadero locations demonstrate a unified vision with thoughtful distinctions based on geographical location and architecture. Occupying a corner Victorian, the Divisadero store's warm, mid-century furnishings are the backdrop for centerpiece sansevieria masoniana in sculptural ceramic vessels designed in collaboration with BZIPPY. A light-filled space with expansive factory windows is the site of the coffee roaster's 20th Street shop, where an above-door ledge with seasonal foliage selections flourish in natural sunlight."
