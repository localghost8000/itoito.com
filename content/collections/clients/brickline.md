description: 'Brickline''s multi-level office in San Mateo balances sleek yet warm interior finishes with abundant plant life. The space''s sun-filled stairwell descends into a veritable forest floor of ferns and monsteras, while pale pink anthuriums and a ruby rubber tree punctuate dark leafy plantings. Lounge spaces are enriched with free-standing patinated stone and terracotta vessels holding palms, XX and a variegated "Thai constellation" monstera.'
